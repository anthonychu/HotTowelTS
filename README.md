HotTowelTS
==========

HotTowel Single Page Application with TypeScript

An empty ASP.NET project with the HotTowel template applied and its core JavaScript files replaced by TypeScript.

TypeScript files need to be compiled using the â€“module AMD option (I'm using the Web Essentials 2012 Extension to do this for me).
